# Reinforcement_learning_for_trading
This repository is an example of how to create a reinforcement learning (RL) environment for trading in the stock market.

In this repository, I used the historical stock market data of Tata Motors to create a reinforcement learning environment and trained an agent on it. I then printed the total number of actions taken by the agent and the final net worth it achieved.

Finally, I tested the agent on a different dataset of Tata Motors' stock prices and displayed the final net worth it obtained.

Further changes can be done to this. You can change the trading logic, train on 5-minute or 30-minute data (as this agent was trained on 4-year data).
